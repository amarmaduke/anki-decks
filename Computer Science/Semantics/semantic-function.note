[[Front]]
In the semantics of programming languages, what is a semantic function?

[[Back]]
A semantic function takes a syntactic structure (which optionally may depend on some state) and returns either a semantic value.
The semantic value is implied to be of some abstract mathematical value.

e.g. \(N : Numeral \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}\)
